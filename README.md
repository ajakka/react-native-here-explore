## Introduction

The react-native-here-navigate library is designed to integrate HERE Maps SDK's features into React Native, one feature at a time.
Crafted from scratch utilizing latest languages in the native domain (Kotlin/Swift), it ensures a streamlined installation process despite the manual approach required for the SDKs themselves.
This library bridges the gap, bringing mapping capabilities into your React Native applications with ease and efficiency.
